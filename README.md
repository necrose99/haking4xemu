===========

This is my bad Gentoo overlay.  It kills kittens, threatens babies, and even juliennes.

It's a repo for whatever DFIR packages I feel like packaging that are either not up to my wishes upstream or are languishing.  Sometimes this requires packaging a lot more than the origin package to do it right.

I've added an eclass to shorten/reduce the workload on maintaining all these libyal ebuilds, but it's probably broken in some subtly dangerous way.  I will gradually migrate the remaining libyal ebuilds to that eclass as updates and time allow.
